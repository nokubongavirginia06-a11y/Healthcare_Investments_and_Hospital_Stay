# Healthcare Investments and Hospital Stay Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset examining the relationship between healthcare investments (MRI units, CT scanners, and hospital beds) and the average length of hospital stay across different locations and over time. The goal is to understand the trends, distributions, and correlations within the data to gain insights into how healthcare infrastructure might be related to hospital stay duration.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Healthcare_Investments_and_Hospital_Stay (1).csv`. It contains the following columns:

*   `Location`: The geographical location (country or region).
*   `Time`: The year of the observation.
*   `Hospital_Stay`: The average length of hospital stay.
*   `MRI_Units`: Number of MRI units per million population.
*   `CT_Scanners`: Number of CT scanners per million population.
*   `Hospital_Beds`: Number of hospital beds per thousand population.

## Analysis Performed

The exploratory data analysis included the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:** The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The first few rows were displayed, data types were checked, and the dataset was inspected for missing values.
2.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Descriptive statistics were calculated for both numerical and categorical columns to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data.
3.  **Univariate Analysis:** The distributions of individual features were visualized using histograms, box plots, and count plots to understand their characteristics and identify potential outliers.
4.  **Bivariate Analysis:** Relationships between pairs of features were explored using scatter plots and a correlation matrix visualized as a heatmap. This helped to identify potential associations between healthcare investments and hospital stay, as well as relationships between the investment metrics themselves.
5.  **Handling Missing Values:** The dataset was checked for missing values.

## Key Findings

*   The dataset is complete with no missing values.
*   The average length of hospital stay varies across locations and over time.
*   There appears to be a weak positive correlation between healthcare investment metrics (MRI Units, CT Scanners, Hospital Beds) and the average length of hospital stay.
*   A moderate negative correlation was observed between the `Time` variable and `Hospital_Stay`, suggesting a potential trend of decreasing hospital stays over the years covered by the dataset.
*   The investment-related features (`MRI_Units`, `CT_Scanners`, `Hospital_Beds`) are strongly positively correlated with each other, which is expected as they represent different aspects of healthcare infrastructure investment.

## How to Run the Analysis

The analysis was performed using Python and key libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook format (or equivalent Colab notebook).

To replicate the analysis:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2.  Download the dataset `Healthcare_Investments_and_Hospital_Stay (1).csv`.
3.  Run the code cells in the provided notebook sequentially.

## Future Work

Based on the initial analysis, potential future steps include:

*   Performing more in-depth time series analysis on `Hospital_Stay` to model the trend and identify contributing factors.
*   Investigating the impact of `Location` on `Hospital_Stay` using grouping and visualization techniques.
*   Building a regression model to predict `Hospital_Stay` based on healthcare investment metrics and other relevant features.
*   Exploring potential data transformations or handling of outliers if necessary for further modeling.
